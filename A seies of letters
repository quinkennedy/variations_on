A seies of letters
_present_

_p_ reminds me of urination for (perhaps) obvious reasons.
_r_ make me think of the word _railroad_. Will this only be an exercise in word-association? Why is it that I think of _railroad_ and not _radio_, or _rug_, or the _rrrrrrrev_ of a speeding _racecar_?

I am in a teacher's office in an elemantary school that I don't go to. Large windows on one side face a one-lane street across a moat of lawn. The room is a brownish beige, with books neatly standing on shelves and books neatly stacked above shelves. I have my lips parted, my teeth together, my tongue pressed slightly against the back of my teeth, yes, teeth together. I am practicing _S_s. I am at my speech therapist's.

I am in a school bus. My school didn't use school busses for picking kids up in the morning. All the kids needed to be brought to school every morning and picked up in the afternoon. Today we are on the way to the Snoopy Ice Arena. On the school bus kids keep asking me to say "monster". I comply and they all burst out laughing. Again they egg me on to say it and, slightly miffed, I say it again. "Mawnsthtah". Uproarious laughter.

At the speech therapist's, she tells me to imagine a railroad track running along the top of my mouth. She instructs me to run my tongue along these tracks whenever I pronounce the _r_ sound. It is fortunate for a teacher tutoring an easily distracted child that the word _railroad_ both re-inforces the visualisation, and provides an opportunity for verbal practice.

I remember living life on a tight budget with my mother. Even though she worried about finances, she always found enough for things she thought were un-negotiable. Good dental coverage was one thing, and when it became apparent that I had a lisp, a speech therapist was another.
