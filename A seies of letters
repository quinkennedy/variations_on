A seies of letters
_present_

_p_ reminds me of urination for (perhaps) obvious reasons.
_r_ make me think of the word _railroad_. Will this only be an exercise in word-association? Why is it that I think of _railroad_ and not _radio_, or _rug_, or a speeding racecar (because _rrrr_ is the sound of the engine, it is happy coincidence that the word also starts with _r_). I remember being in a teacher's office in an elemantary school that I don't go to. large windows on one side face a one-lane street across a moat of lawn. The room is a brownish beige, with books on top of shelves in various degrees of orderliness. There is not a sense of clutter though. I am at my speech therapist's.

I am in a school bus. My school didn't use school busses for picking kids up in the morning. All the parents had to drive their kids to the school every morning and pick them up in the afternoon. We are in the school bus on a fieldtrip. It was common for us to go to the Snoopy Ice Arena a couple of times a year. It turns out Charles Schultz lived in our city, and had apparently helped finance this ice rink in some way. On the school bus kids keep asking me to say "monster". I realize that all that will stumble out of my mouth is "mawnsthtah". The kids laugh at my lisp and continue to egg me on. I don't remember why I continued to capitulate, perhaps I enjoyed the attention.

At the speech therapist's, she tells me to imagine a railroad track running along the top of my mouth. She instructs me to run my tongue along these tracks whenever I pronounce the _r_ sound. It is fortunate for a teacher tutoring an easily distracted child that the word _railroad_ both re-inforces the visualisation, and provides an opportunity for verbal practice.

I remember living life on a tight budget with my mother. Even though she worried about finances, she always found enough for things she thought were un-negotiable. Good dental coverage was one thing, and when it became apparent that I had a lisp, a speech therapist was another. I'm grateful for that experience.
