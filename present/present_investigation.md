a personal investigation of the series of letters: present

As I begin to think of the work "present" in increasingly abstract ways, eventually I perceive it not as a set of words that share common spelling, or a set of sounds that can be generated from said spelling, but merely as a series of letters.

As I move though the series of letters, in left-to-right fashion as I am trained to do, I first encounter "p". I immediately word-associate this with the act of uniration, since a synonym of urination is a verb who's base form is a homonym with the letter "p". Why I think of the verb instead of the object is not obviouse, but I speculate it is due to the compelling nature of action.

Next we have the letter "r". I associate this letter most readily with the word "railroad".

I stop short of contemplating it as a series of glyphs, or perhaps even further it could be a series of combinations of glyph pieces. The plunging vertical bar combined with a right-ward arch, followed by a standing vertical combined with a right-ward overhang, and so on. These abstract forms hold no immediate personal meaning to me, and thus my investigation takes at least a prolonged pause at this stage.

r: Rail-road. As a child I went to a speaking tutor because I had a lisp. The kids at school would always make me say "monster", which I pronounced "mawnsthtah", and proceed to laugh at me. The speech tutor told me to visualize a set of rail-road tracks along my palate. The tip of my tounge should travel up and back along the tracks as I pronounce the "r" sound.
e: Extacy. I was with a friend recently who had a headache. While we were contemplating going to a club, he asked "does extacy alleviate headaches?"
