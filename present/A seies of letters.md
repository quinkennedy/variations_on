###A series of letters

_p._

_r._ makes me think of the word _railroad_. Why is it that I think of _railroad_ and not _radio_, or _rug_, or the _rrrrrrrev_ of a speeding _racecar_?

I am in a teacher's office in an elementary school that I don't go to. Large windows face a one-lane street across a moat of lawn. The room is a brownish beige; books neatly standing on shelves, books neatly stacked above shelves. I have my lips parted, teeth together, my tongue pressed slightly against the back of my teeth, yes, teeth together. I am practicing Ss. I am at my speech therapist's.

I am in a school bus. My school didn't use school busses for picking kids up in the morning. All the kids needed to be brought to school in the morning and picked up in the afternoon. Today we are on our way to the Snoopy Ice Arena. On the school bus kids keep asking me to say "monster". I comply and they all burst out laughing. They egg me on and, slightly miffed, I say it again. "Mawnsthtah". Uproarious laughter.

At the speech therapist's, she tells me to imagine a railroad track running along the top of my mouth. She instructs me to run my tongue along these tracks whenever I pronounce the r sound. It is fortunate for a teacher tutoring an easily distracted child that the word _railroad_ both reinforces the visualisation, and provides an opportunity for verbal practice.

I remember living life on a tight budget with my mother. Even though she worried about finances, she always found enough for things she thought were un-negotiable. Good dental coverage was one thing, and when it became apparent that I had a lisp, a speech therapist was another.
